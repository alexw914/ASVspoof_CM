% 
% Compute Tandem Detection Cost Function (t-DCF) [1] for a fixed ASV system. 
% In brief, t-DCF returns a detection cost of a cascaded system of this form,
% 
%   Speech waveform -> [CM] -> [ASV] -> decision
% 
% where CM stands for countermeasure and ASV for automatic speaker
% verification. The CM is therefore used as a 'gate' to decided whether or
% not the input speech sample should be passed onwards to the ASV system.
% Generally, both CM and ASV can do detection errors. Not all those errors
% are necessarily equally cost, and not all types of users are necessarily
% equally likely. The tandem t-DCF gives a principled with to compare
% different spoofing countermeasures under a detection cost function
% framework that takes that information into account.
% 
% INPUTS:
% 
%   bonafide_score_cm   A vector of POSITIVE CLASS (bona fide or human) 
%                       detection scores obtained by executing a spoofing 
%                       countermeasure (CM) on some positive evaluation trials.
%                       trial represents a bona fide case. 
%   spoof_score_cm      A vector of NEGATIVE CLASS (spoofing attack)
%                       detection scores obtained by executing a spoofing
%                       CM on some negative evaluation trials.
%   Pfa_asv             False alarm (false acceptance) rate of the ASV
%                       system that is evaluated in tandem with the CM.
%                       Assumed to be in fractions, not percentages.
%   Pmiss_asv           Miss (false rejection) rate of the ASV system that
%                       is evaluated in tandem with the spoofing CM.
%                       Assumed to be in fractions, not percentages.
%   Pmiss_spoof_asv     Miss rate of spoof samples of the ASV system that
%                       is evaluated in tandem with the spoofing CM. That
%                       is, the fraction of spoof samples that were
%                       rejected by the ASV system. 
%   cost_model          A struct that contains the parameters of t-DCF,
%                       with the following fields.
% 
%                       Ptar        Prior probability of target speaker.
%                       Pnon        Prior probability of nontarget speaker (zero-effort impostor)
%                       Psoof       Prior probability of spoofing attack.
%                       Cmiss_asv   Cost of ASV falsely rejecting target.
%                       Cfa_asv     Cost of ASV falsely accepting nontarget.
%                       Cmiss_cm    Cost of CM falsely rejecting target.
%                       Cfa_cm      Cost of CM falsely accepting spoof.
%                           
%   print_cost          Print a summary of the cost parameters and the
%                       implied t-DCF cost function? 
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% 
%   tDCF_norm           Normalized t-DCF curve across the different CM
%                       system operating points; see [2] for more details.
%                       Normalized t-DCF > 1 indicates a useless
%                       countermeasure (as the tandem system would do
%                       better without it). min(tDCF_norm) will be the
%                       minimum t-DCF used in ASVspoof 2019 [2].
%   CM_thresholds       Vector of same size as tDCF_norm corresponding to
%                       the CM threshold (operating point). 
% 
% NOTE:
% o     In relative terms, higher detection scores values are assumed to 
%       indicate stronger support for the bona fide hypothesis.
% o     You should provide real-valued soft scores, NOT hard decisions. The
%       recommendation is that the scores are log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)
%       from a bonafide-vs-spoof hypothesis based on some statistical model.
%       This, however, is NOT required. The scores can have arbitrary range
%       and scaling.
% o     Pfa_asv, Pmiss_asv, Pmiss_spoof_asv are in fractions, not percentages.
